## 🔥 High Priority

~~Finalize and document pre-built theme configurations:~~
- ✅ `compact` — Smaller sizes, tighter spacing
- ✅ `comfortable` — Larger, more spacious
- ✅ `rounded` — Full border radius everywhere
- ✅ `sharp` — Square corners
- ✅ `minimal` — Subtle colors, less visual noise
- ✅ `vibrant` — Bold, saturated colors

**Usage:** `npx czero build --preset compact`
